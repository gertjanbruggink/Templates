## 1. Dashboards

Dashboards for visualising your digital footprint.

## 2. Threat actor baseball cards

There's much to be said on the level of detail you need to capture in your own threat intelligence repository. I've added a good-enough template to this repo to serve as a basis for your program. Bare in mind that this is dependent on the audience as well! Sometimes you just report on: Threat actor(s), Category	(e.g. Organized cybercrime group), Capability	(e.g. Medium; <explanation>) and Intent	(e.g. Low; explanation>).

## 3. Threat briefing template

If you are looking for a fun and engaging way to inform your organization on current threats and cyber affairs, look no more! You can leverage this template for that. It's meant to give you a starting point in creating your own briefing format.
